dumb guy: why is there 2 billion views when there are 7 million people on earth? also, i know what 1+1 equals! 1+1=1! i am a smartie pants 
people who say that "this song is too old now, there's no point of listening to it" suck. just stfu and enjoy the music. so, your mom is old too but you still listen to her right. 
the funny thing is that this song was made in 2009 but it took 2 years to get to america. 
why i don't see any comments but mine/ 
this jap is such a piece of shit. he is such a worthless fish head. i don't know how any one likes this dumb untanlted gook. this isnt even fucken music. this is so fucking sad that this is even such thing. people are so fucked up. 
i remember when everyone was obsessed with gangnam style 
remove this video its wank 
it's so hard, sad. ithat little child actor hwang minoo dancing very active child is suffering from brain tumor, only 6 month left for him hard to believe keep praying everyone for our future superstar. stronglittlepsy fighting share everyone praying for him http//ygunitedcom/2014/11/08/little-psy-from-the-has-brain-tumor-6-months-left-to-live/ 
why the fuck this keeps updated? comments "5 minutes ago" song: "2 years and 4 months ago" 
many memories. 
why are they 5million comments when there is only 279898 youtube users. 5million fake account or psy hacked youtube 
2000000000 out of 7000000000 people in the would saw this video just in 2 years and yeat i only get 2 words out of the hole song 
this video is so cool, again and again! 
i am now going to voyage to the first comment. tell my family i loved them. 
how did this video in all of youtube get this many views and likes? why gangnam style? i don't have a problem with it, i just don't understand the phenomena behind it, it's just like any other random music video out there. 
with the korean girl more slut and bitch hyuna '33 
hey guys! check this out: kollektivet - don't be slappin' my penis! i think that they deserve much more credit than they receive.

c'mon 3 billion views! 
hey everyone, i am a new channel and will post videos of book reviews and music on the flute. please subscribe if you would enjoy that. thanks! 
hey i think i know what where dealing with here! i have some theories of how this could've gotten 2billion hits! 1. this was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were stuck watching this over and over again. 2. over 2billion people have access to the internet, including youtube, and the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. hackers in korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion hits to make it more popular. 4. the song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. you are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits. 
subscribe my chanel

i am sorry for the spam but my name is jenny. i go to high school where everyone dresses fashionable but for me i don't because i need money to buy cute clothes. i have low self esteem i live with my dad. my mom passed away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. i have 2 brothers who is older than me. since they are boys they get the attention while i just be alone. i really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. i am very quite and shy at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone. i did have one friend name caroline but she moved away so now i am alone. if you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes. also i wanna get my nails done at a salon i see alot of girls have these french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http//wwwgofundmecom/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.

my honest opinion. it's a very mediocre song. nothing unique or special about her music, lyrics or voice. nothing memorable like billie jean or beat it. before her millions of fans reply with hate comments, i know this is a democracy and people are free to see what they want. but then don't i have the right to express my opinion? please don't reply with dumb comments lie "if you don't like it don't watch it". i just came here to see what's the buzz about661 million views) and didn't like what i saw. ok?

how do you forget you have a choice, and what the fuck, surviving a plane crash has a 1/1000 chance of happening. 
she is a fool. this is a foolish video. the lyrics are all about her and how great she is. she is arrogant, obviously. but the thing is that there are a lot of idiots. look how many hits this garnered. the young stupid girls who listen to her are numbering in the millions i guess. this video is a piece of trash. why would anyone ever like it or listen to it? because these stupid little girls have idiots for fathers and mothers. and so they are going to turn into idiots also. just like this stupid singer. 
attention we need 10 million views more for firework to reach 500m we have only 1 and half day left for katy's birtgday. listen how it could be possible? just open different tabs from different browser don't watch full video, remember we don't have time on hand, its time wasting. view it only for 30 sec. please thumbs up and share

katy perry can't sing for shit. all i hear it autotune. 
i fucking hate her. why? because she don't write her songs she got producers for that. second why tha fack is she in every song almost nude mayby because she's an attention hooker. 
also luckymusiqlive she probably could help you make it big because i think you have talent. just look her name up on the internet. hit me up when you get this message

i'd rather hear some propa explicit gangsta rap insted of this garbage. this song is trash 
damnnnnnnnn, she is sexy oo 
such a good song ans katy sounds great over the melody. i am growing as an artist everyday from my hit song 'crazy' which has got my name out there. cant thank my fans more for their support. if you could take a moment? to check it and my music? maybe you'll join me to make my dream come true. thank you for your time 
i love you! because you make me smile when i am sad you cheer me up with your beautiful songs 
this song is the most boring, asinine song i have ever heard. coming from a guy who liked "teenage dream" the song. ever since katy perry's divorce it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs. for those of you saying "this is the next wave of pop music". stick it up your ass. katy perry is like silly putty. 
katy perry - roar official: http//youtube/cevxzvsjlk8. i love this song and video katy perry rocks wahoo! 
and somehow she has access to makeup in the middle of the woods. 
it looks so real and my daughter is a big fan and she likes a lot of your songs. 
i can't comprehend why this video has nearly 700000000 views. some people found 'gangnam style' funny so that explains its high view count but this is just an awful pop song. i really have no clue on this one. 
lets be honest, you wouldn't last 1 day on your own in the jungle. stop living n a fairy world. 
me segue ha https//wwwfacebookcom/marcossousa4fref=ts 
nature is beautiful, no need to place tits in video to impress people. 
this is so stupid. if you roared at a lion in real life you'd dede 
this song is so awesomeshe made everything stand out and all the viewers could imagine themselves at the setting of the video. awesome job katy perry!

i've figured out why i dislike this song: it's supposed to be a power ballad right? something that's uplifting and motivating by the end. however, the final chorus has no extra umph at the end and actually sounds just like the first one. instead of crescendo-ing into a powerful finish, "roar" just says on the same wavelength. it falls flat. 
i like this song the video goes perfect with it 
"because i am a championand you're gonna hear me roar" today i am my own champion today i am a champion for the creator today i am doing positive in my world today i am blessing and healing all around me today i am successful and creating success

all school drop outs i knew as friends before they decided to drop school think there is no need for an id card or a certification to prove you are an educated clean in criminal record talented person to work in any entertainment field worldwide. they think they could be rich entertainers by consolidating with actors / actresses as well as singers for a share of profits.

wow justin bieber is better thats why when he buys medication he always shares with his half wited money alfred but sadly enough he is an attention hog with swamp ass and an eating disorder filled with sassy mice, and flaming hot cheetos that he can eat with the power of the samurman. 
this fucking song like a'n oreo the only white part is the good 1 
no where near one of eminems actual best songs, real fans know what i am talking about: untitled, cold wind blows, welcome 2 hell, elevator, business, wtp, almost famous, 25 to life, rock bottom, no apologies, same song and dance, without me, way i am, toy soldiers, mosh and insane songs off the top of my head that's better 
finally someone shares the same opinion as me. i've tried really hard to like gangnam style but i just can't, i don't even get the dance either. a song like this should be more popular than gangnam style, at least it makes sense.

watch youtube video "eminem -ytma artist of the year" please share to vote! 
made five years ago and people still don't understand the message this song is conveying. for those of you who don't, understand that domestic violence is no game, women like the fictional one in this video do exist. living their lives with a man who abuses her, but still chooses to stay for not the love, but for the sexual feeling he gives her. this is quite sad, actually. 
5 years and i still don't get the music video help someone?

i really love watching football and also ive started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. its this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on betfair. you secure the bonus as income a chap named jim vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website vanstone secrets google it. ive made about 500 quid thus far. and it is cost-free. i guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works. 
and how many subscribers compared to her over a million 
i absolutely adore watching football plus ive started earning income with out risk from claiming bonus deals. its a weird technique where you put money on something with one bookmakers and put money against it on betfair. you acquire the bonus as income a lad named jim vanstone is selecting the wagers free on his website vanstone secrets google it. i have generated about 600 quid so far. and its free. i assume the bookmakers pay him to get new men and women, but it succeeds.

o peoples of the earth, i have seen how you perform every form of evil at your leisure! you cease not from reveling in that which i hate! behold, you murder the innocent day and night and plot evil against your neighbor! you stand up for the rights of those who commit abomination and clap your hands as wickedness is celebrated openly in the streets. o most perverse and abominable generation, shall i not repay! hear the word of the lord - trumpetcallofgodonline. co m
