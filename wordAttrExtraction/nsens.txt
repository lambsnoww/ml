People Who Say That "This Song Is Too Old Now, There's No Point Of  Listening To It" Suck. Just Stfu And Enjoy The Music. So, Your Mom Is Old  Too But You Still Listen To Her Right?....﻿
The Funny Thing Is That this song was made in 2009 but it took 2 years to  get to america.﻿

I remember when everyone was obsessed with Gangnam Style 😗﻿
Remove This video its wank﻿
Why the fuck this keeps updated? Comments :"5 minutes ago" Song: "2 years and  4 months ago"﻿
MANY MEMORIES...........﻿
why are they 5million comments when there is only 279.898 youtube Users.   5million fake account or PSY hacked youtube﻿
2,000,000,000 out of 7,000,000,000 people in the would saw this video just  in 2 years and yeat i only get 2 words out of the hole song﻿
This video is so cool, again and again!﻿
I am now going to voyage to the first comment...      Tell my family I loved them. 😢﻿
How did THIS Video in all of YouTube get this many views and likes? Why  Gangnam style? I don't have a problem with it, i just don't understand the  phenomena behind it, it's just like any other random music video out  there. ﻿
With the korean girl more slut and bitch : Hyuna :'33﻿
Still a very fun music video to watch! ﻿
C'mon 3 billion views!!!!!!!!﻿
Hey I think I know what where dealing with here!!!! I have some theories of  how this could've gotten 2billion hits!! 1. This was mabey made in korea and its realy popular there so they were  stuck watching this over and over again. 2. Over 2billion people have access to the Internet, including youtube, and  the numbers are rising, by 2017 half of the populatoin will be connected. 3. Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5. You are complaining to much on how the heck this has 2b hits.﻿
THIS HAS MORE VIEWS THAN QUEEN AND MICHAEL JACKSON, 2 BILLION views omg﻿
LoL﻿
If you pause at 1:39 at the last millisecond you can see that that chick is  about to laugh. Takes a few tries.﻿
9 year olds be like, 'How does this have 2 billion views when there are  only 3 people in the world'﻿
PSY is a good guy﻿
WHY DOES THIS HAVE 2 BILLION VIEWS THIS SONG IS SO ANNOYING﻿
1 millioon dislikesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss.............﻿
The little PSY is suffering Brain Tumor and only has 6 more months to live.  Please pray to him and the best lucks.﻿
For all of the little kidz out there there is Like 7 to 8 Billon people on  earth NOT 7 to 8 MILLON.Get you facts straight before posting comments.﻿

What my gangnam style﻿
Lol this youtuber (officialpsy) is getting so much money lol﻿
1 million dislikes!EPIC FAIL(ready for you fanboys)﻿
If I knew Korean, this would be even funnier. At least a bit at the end was  in English, but was spoken quite rapidly.﻿
Enough with the whole "how does this have two billion views if there's only  7 million on the planet" we get it. You're joking. It's not funny anymore.﻿
YOUTUBE MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
2 billion for this shit?﻿
2 billion views, only 2 million shares﻿
2 billion views wow not even baby by justin beibs has that much he doesn't  deserve a capitalized name﻿
 I hate this song! ﻿
NEW GOAL!   3,000,000!  Let's go for it!﻿
just came here to check the views :P﻿
I hav absolutely no idea what he's saying. Is it even a language?﻿
I still to this day wonder why this video is so popular ?? illuminati  confirmed ??﻿
This is getting old.........﻿
just came to check the view count﻿
If the shitty Chinese Government didn't block YouTube over there, there'd  be close to 3 billion views right now. ﻿
WORLD RECORD YOUTUBE VIDEO VIEWS !!!!!! XD﻿
I think he was drunk during this :) x)﻿
Hahah, juyk! I allways laugh at the part 1:57.. LOL!﻿
I wanted to know the name of the guy that dances at 00:58, anybody knows ?﻿
Haha its so funny to see the salt of westerners that top views of youtube  goes to video they dont even understand, keep the salt up!﻿
imagine if this guy put adsense on with all these views... u could pay ur  morgage﻿
The girl in the train who was dancing, her outfit was so fucking sexy, but  the huge turn-off was she lacked eyebrows D:﻿
Don't mind me, I'm just checking what the views are up to : )﻿
To everyone joking about how he hacked to get 2 billion views because  there's a certain amount of people or whatever,  He actually did buy views.﻿
Why does a song like this have more views than Michael Jackson SMH﻿
 Something to dance to, even if your sad JUST dance!!   PSY - GANGNAM STYLE (강남스타일) M/V: http://youtu.be/9bZkp7q19f0﻿
everyones back lool this is almost 3 years old and people are still hear!  xD﻿
How can this have 2 billion views when there's only me on the planet? LOL﻿
I don't now why I'm watching this in 2014﻿
The first billion viewed this because they thought it was really cool, the  other billion and a half came to see how stupid the first billion were...﻿
katy perry does remind me of a tiger,like as if its her spirit animal :3 &lt;3﻿
In what South American jungle or any jungle for that matter do you find an  African elephant and a bengal tiger in the same place. Who made this video.﻿
Its a good song and i like her video clip, because its a bout a girl that  her airplane crashed on a land far far away... and she found the way to  survive! And i love the pet tiget too( Kitty Purpy) lol :D﻿
Thanks to this video we know that Nokia phones can survive a plane crash.﻿
She named the tiger Kitty Purry  No, seriously, she did, check the video ﻿
Perfect! &lt;3﻿
And after the video ends, a 13 ft. boa constrictor squeezes her to death.﻿
should not have paused the music, this is a clip, not a movie.﻿
I love this song, it´s for empowering every woman :)  "you´re gonna hear me roar" ;)﻿
This song makes me want to drink bleach﻿
If she really did this there she's hardcore﻿
I'm sorry Katy Perry, I was being weird. I still love you &lt;3﻿
I'm not a big fan of the song but this video is awesome!﻿
katy perry  just stop it and dont do a song i dont like it﻿
In my opinion I think you look better with black hair then blond hair : )﻿
I loved, she is amazing.. OMG your eyes*_*﻿
You gonna hear me ROARRRR.....﻿
I WILL FINISH THIS DISSERTATION! And I will laugh in its face when I  finish! Roaaarrr =3﻿
She's an old Whore!﻿
ROAAAAARRRRRR 🐯🐯🐯﻿
This looks so fun and it's a good song﻿
I love You Katy ♥﻿
I    loved        it           so       much          because         you          get         to         stand            fear .﻿
3:46 so cute!﻿
i think they were drunk when they shot the first half of the video and then the sec on half comes in, and her boobs are magically bigger and  she's more beautiful suddenly, and the dude practically vanishes ﻿
Roar is without a doubt your best song...feel good song with a message for  everyone. Good job Katy﻿
The great mother of the jungle. Sweet and natural. I like her videos.﻿
Katy has conqueror's haki &gt;:)﻿
There is 7 bilion poeple on earth Now stop being dumb﻿
I love this shit but I disliked it because it's sucks﻿
this video is very inaccurate, a tiger would rip her face of﻿
Are those real animals﻿
Maybe the best music video in the last 15 years? This is how pop music is  done folks!﻿
I love KATY PERRY &lt;3 &lt;3﻿
Boooobs﻿
I really don't understand how this has 600 million views lol. I'm not  hating or anything, it's just confusing. ﻿

My telephone!﻿
This comment will randomly get lot's of likes and replies for no reason. I  also like Jello. Strawberry jello.﻿
really want this video to get 1 billion views, would be amazing!﻿
I started hating Katy Perry after finding out that she stole all of the  ideas on her videos  from an old comic book. Yet, her music is catchy. ﻿
How can this song have 629 million views while there are only 7 million  people in the world?﻿
Katy Perry is garbage. Rihanna is the best singer in the world. ﻿
Katy Perry is part of me Katy Perry is my firework Katy Perry, I love you﻿
This Song Was Good Until It Got Overplayed The Hell Out Of On Radio﻿
see it all, human folly right?﻿
Great.This is a song﻿
Awesum song!! Jus luv it!﻿
Imagine this in the news crazy woman found acting like a tiger and bit jims  ear off﻿
selfie alert﻿
Your going to hear me Roar !!!! :-))))   #soundsofsunday ﻿
It is a shit﻿
i am a big fan of you and i love you﻿
I &lt;3 Katy Perry!﻿
Since she is a feminist champion, why would she want to reinforce the  stereotype of girls being girly by painting the nails of an elephant that  probably wouldn't even appreciate it?﻿
This is fucking shit. From the first notes, that becomes clear. Complete  and utter shit. May God come and cleanse the earth of the complete and  utter idiocy which is humankind.﻿
At least she didn't get rid of her completely useless makeup.﻿
I love roar and Katy Perry. She is my favorite singer and sometimes I just  mute the volume and look at her!﻿
This is the best of the best video in world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
She's got it all. Incredible voice, extremely hot, nice tits﻿
I really like this song.﻿
my son love so much﻿
Y LOVE YOU﻿
why the elephant have a broken horn﻿
Where did she find all that make up in a freakin jungle?!﻿
so cute that monkey *-*! ﻿
Nice song﻿
You are all sheep, period. This is terrible music.﻿
In the beginning she was scared off everything and next thing you know she  is out in a leopard bikini!﻿
I love her green eyes﻿
How old is Katy perry?﻿
most popular video on youtube  ﻿
NOKIA spotted﻿
I hear this all the time on radio and its really irritating. That being  said, i like the video﻿
Fantastic!!!﻿
She's awesome XD﻿
Katy perry songs aren't that bad ﻿
That's Good :)﻿
Awesome video this is one of my favorite  songs😀😀😀😀😀😀😀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💎💎💎💎💎💄💄💄💄💋💋💋💋﻿
If only I had the body like Katy Perry :)). She looks so hot. I love her  ^^!﻿
The song is very good ...but the video makes no sense...just a nonsense  video...I mean she is telling her story of being stuck on an island, but  the song doesn't fit in the situation...but nvm...The song is good﻿
Who else would give Katy perry a good old mighty roar? ;)﻿
OMG I LOVE YOU KATY PARRY YOUR SONGS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THATS A TOTAL  SUBSCRIBE﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
katy perry is awesome﻿
I love this sooooooooooooong I love katy perry﻿
What does that tattoo on her right tricep say?﻿
Since when has Katy Perry had her own YouTube channel?﻿
Every time I watch this mv I just so so so glad that I live in a world that  don't have to worry about running from a real, human eating tiger.﻿
"eye of the tiger" "i am the champion" seems like katy perry is using  titles of old rock songs for lyrics..﻿
She is a perfect wonder.....﻿
she is horrible at acting. cringe-worhty.﻿
Is that tiger called 'Katty Purry'?﻿
blue eyes, can't be trusted.  uranus bless america.﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
C'mon Katy you are so close to 14,000,000 subscribers...come up with  another hit like this and it will happen﻿
My honest opinion. It's a very mediocre song. Nothing unique or special  about her music, lyrics or voice. Nothing memorable like Billie Jean or  Beat It. Before her millions of fans reply with hate comments, i know this  is a democracy and people are free to see what they want. But then don't I  have the right to express my opinion? Please don't reply with dumb comments  lie "if you don't like it don't watch it". I just came here to see what's  the buzz about(661 million views??) and didn't like what i saw. OK?﻿
Wow she is sexy XD﻿
Katy has a voice of an Angel﻿
This video is so racist!!! There are only animals.﻿
Man she is BEAUTIFUL!﻿
Yesterday this video have 1 million likes and now it has 2 million﻿
why tiger succumbs to a beautiful girl ?.probably male tiger.....????   ha.ha.ha..﻿
Best song ever ﻿
She is good. Does she make any more music? If she doesn't, she should!﻿
I LOVE YOU KATTY PERRY &lt;3 ﻿
HONESTLY, I WANNA SEE YOU BE BRAVE! oh wait...﻿
;-)﻿
this video is great .....!!! I love this........and like much katy perry﻿
Good thing she brought her spray-on tan, hairstylist, makeup artist, and  cameraman.﻿
666,002,018 views! 666 million. 666! Katy Perry illuminati confirmed!!!﻿
It should be illegal to be this goodlooking as this babe is...﻿
katy is mine the girl of my dreams ♥﻿
I love this song﻿
She is fit﻿
I love the song roar it make me think am fill the way﻿
How do you forget you have a choice, and what the fuck, surviving a plane  crash has a 1/1000 chance of happening.﻿
she is a fool. this is a foolish video. the lyrics are all about her and  how great she is. she is arrogant, obviously. but the thing is that there  are a lot of idiots.. look how many hits this garnered. the young stupid  girls who listen to her are numbering in the millions i guess. this video  is a piece of trash. why would anyone ever like it or listen to it? because  these stupid little girls have idiots for fathers and mothers.. and so they  are going to turn into idiots also.. just like this stupid singer. ﻿
I just realized that this verses in this song have the exact same melody as  the verses in "Hey Ho" by the Lumineers.﻿
:-D ♪♪♪ This is my favorite song ♥﻿
this song never get's old &lt;3 ﻿
I like you . Katy Perry 600▲60▲6▲﻿
Glad to know im not the only one who knows its katheryn's birthday today :)  happy birthday katy...and my sister. (they seriously have the same  birthday...)﻿
Katy Perry can't sing for shit. All i hear it autotune.﻿
I fucking hate her. Why? Because she don't write her songs she got  producers for that. Second why tha fack is she in every song almost nude  mayby because she's an attention hooker.﻿
Put famous people in the jungle for an hour and look what happens.﻿
She kinda let herself go, huh?﻿
we all love you Katy Perry &lt;3﻿
Love it when I can relate to my daughter's music. :-) Katy Perry - Roar  (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official)  #soundsofsunday   #music  ﻿
When I hear Katy singing this, I cry. The song has got depth.﻿
Love it﻿
People who believe in Illuminati are stupid the same people believe that  911 was made by the American government﻿
00 : 39 Im pretty sure that tiger just wanted a hug﻿
i love you katy perry because you will sing nice than shakira﻿
I love katty perry﻿
Οh my god ... Roar is the most liked video at Vevo .. while 2 months ago  was Justin's Baby.. congrats Katy . Applause &lt;3 ﻿
I'd rather hear some propa explicit gangsta rap insted of this garbage.  This song is trash !﻿
DAMNNNNNNNN, she is sexy O_O﻿
I LOVE YOU!!! Because u make me smile when im sad you cheer me up with your  beautiful songs (: &lt;3﻿
This song is the most boring, asinine song I have ever heard. Coming from a  guy who liked "Teenage Dream" (the song). Ever since Katy Perry's divorce  it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs... For those of you  saying "This is the next wave of pop music". Stick it up your ass. Katy  Perry is like Silly Putty. ﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8. I love this song  and video Katy Perry Rocks Wahoo! 😀😘﻿
And somehow she has access to makeup in the middle of the woods...﻿
It looks so real and my daughter is a big fan and she likes a lot of your  songs.﻿
I can't comprehend why this video has nearly 700,000,000 views. Some people  found 'Gangnam Style' funny so that explains its high view count but this  is just an awful pop song. I really have no clue on this one.﻿
Lets be honest, you wouldn't last 1 day on your own in the jungle. Stop  living n a fairy world.﻿
Nature is beautiful, no need to place tits in video to impress people.﻿
This is so stupid. If you Roared at a Lion in real life you'd dede﻿
This song is so AWESOME!!!She made everything stand out and all the viewers  could imagine themselves at the setting of the video. Awesome Job Katy  Perry!!!!﻿
Katy Perry - Roar (Official): http://youtu.be/CevxZvSJLk8﻿
Katy Perry is lion﻿
I've figured out why I dislike this song: it's supposed to be a power  ballad right? Something that's uplifting and motivating by the end.  However, the final chorus has NO extra UMPH at the end and actually sounds  just like the first one. Instead of crescendo-ing into a powerful finish,  "Roar" just says on the same wavelength. It falls flat.﻿
i like this song the video goes perfect with it﻿
"....because I AM a champion...and you're gonna hear me roar!"   Today I AM my own champion  Today I AM a champion for the Creator  Today I AM doing positive in my world Today I AM blessing and healing all around me Today I AM successful and  creating success  ﻿
Katy Perry's songs are the best of the songs of women artists.﻿
i like this song because of all the animals and i like this song .﻿
I love this song so much!:-D I've heard it so much I pretty much memorized  the lyrics﻿
great song, but we all know that Katy buys her views..﻿
I hate videos like these with those poor animals.﻿
Hii youtube﻿
nice ..very nice﻿
I love this song!!!﻿
*KATY YOU ARE A SHIT GO DIE!!!!!ROAR IS A FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP*﻿
 I love your music ﻿
My 6th grade teacher looked exactly like Katy Perry come to think of it...﻿
Almost 1 Bil. What? Wow, GS sucks, in my opinion.﻿
Katty is the best! ! ! ! ﻿
That was very good I mean very very much good ﻿
This song means so much to me thank you  soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much:-) Xxx﻿
&lt;3﻿
Honestly speaking except taylor swift and adele i don't lile any of the  modern day singers. But i must say whenever i hear this song i feel  goosebumps. Its quite inspiring!! Thanks miss Perry!﻿

The perfect example of abuse from husbands and the thing is I&#39;m a feminist so I definitely agree with this song and well...if I see this someone&#39;s going to die! Just sayin.﻿
The boyfriend was Charlie from the TV show LOST ﻿
Rihanna and Eminem together are unstoppable.﻿
This song is about Rape and Cheating     <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Basically.....﻿
I love this song, can&#39;t believe it was 5 years ago, it doesn&#39;t get old though﻿
OMG that looks just like a piece of the mirror of harry potter and the deathly hallows.<br />Either that house. (sirius black)﻿
You exactly who u want to be,watching your favourite rappers on tv﻿
Rihanna is absolutely gorgeous in this video.﻿
Don&#39;t love someone soo much, love the way u lie..﻿
one of the BEST SONGS in music history﻿
No-I hate The Way U LIe!!﻿
Fuck Eminem. Bieber is the best &lt;3﻿
Love😘❤💖﻿
Haha, I can&#39;t believe how many kids listen to Eminem.  You kids know that he does drugs and ends high in jail. I wonder why he never ended OD. ﻿
this is the 2nd most best song when im gone by m&amp;m﻿
WE GO FOR 1,000,000,000 FOR EMINEM﻿

no where near one of eminems actual best songs, real fans know what im talking about: Untitled, cold wind blows, welcome 2 hell, elevator, business, wtp, almost famous, 25 to life, rock bottom, no apologies, same song and dance, without me, way i am, toy soldiers, mosh and insane &lt; songs off the top of my head that&#39;s better﻿
Still listening,still same pleasure﻿
I love you!❤✨﻿

awesome song ever﻿
love﻿
do you guys know, there&#39;s a part two of this song! :D﻿
Hey, it&#39;s Charlie from Lost﻿
I guss this song is one of my worst fears in life, to be with someone who abusive towered me and live with him.... ﻿
Made five years ago and people still don&#39;t understand the message this song is conveying. For those of you who don&#39;t, understand that domestic violence is no game, women like the fictional one in this video do exist. Living their lives with a man who abuses her, but still chooses to stay for not the love, but for the sexual feeling he gives her. This is quite sad, actually. ﻿
5 years and i still dont get the music video help someone?﻿
This video is kinda close to 1 million  views <br />﻿
Fuck you Eminem﻿
2008-2010 were the years for pop﻿
sorry but eminmem is a worthless wife beating bastard﻿
so spousal abusue cool that&#39;s great﻿
she is megan fox?because she is very similar﻿
Holy crap. 800,000,000 views?!﻿

Lamest World Cup song ever! This time FOR Africa? You mean IN Africa. It wasn&#39;t a Live Aid event or something. She made it seem like a charity case for them instead of a proud moment. Where was Ricky Martin when you needed him! SMH﻿
